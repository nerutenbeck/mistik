This paper reviews the functional ecology of various boreal species with the goal of summarizing their relative importance as advance regeneration species (ability to reach pole size in the shaded understory).
This paper makes the important point that the ability to grow quickly in shade may indicate lower potential for survival in persistent shade.
It concludes that the inability of pine and aspen to survive in shade appears to be related to shoot, crown, and tree levels rather than the leaf level.},

This paper models annual fire intensity (burn rate) as random draws from a lognormal distribution with mean and variance parameterized from historical burn rate data.
Monte Carlo simulations of various lengths are used to attempt to characterize the 'natural' fire intensity and age class distribution as a guide for management.
Simulations result in highly variable estimates of mean annual area burned and highly variable age structures regardless of simulation length. Author argues that assuming one 'natural' distribution of age classes may be unwarranted.},

Seedlings of the three species (2160 total, 720 per species) were transplanted into five plot locations (center plus northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast gap edges) within all gap and understory sites. Measurements of microclimates, architecture, photosynthetic performance, survival, and growth were made over 1 yr before, and 2 yr following, gap release. Red maple (A. rubrum) survived better overall across the study due to greater persistence in the north and center plots of large gaps. The small gaps and understories showed no differences among the species. Survival rates exceeded 80\% in most sites and plots, with low values (30-65\%) only in the exposed plots of large gaps. There were no relationships between post-gap survival and previous age, height, or basal diameter. By the end of 2 yr of gap release, both gap sizes induced greater distinctions among the species in all growth variables than the understory. Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) exhibited greater leader extension, absolute stem height, net height change, absolute basal diameter, and net basal diameter change than red maple and sugar maple (in that order) in nearly all sites and plots. The exception was large-gap center and north plots, where red maple equalled or exceeded striped maple in net basal diameter change, but not net height increase. Sugar maple (A. saccharum) was the least responsive of the species to the gap-understory gradient. As with survival, there were no predictable relationships between pregap age or size and post-gap growth. Photosynthetic performance paralleled growth by these species across the gradient, particularly for shoot assimilation. When growth variables were plotted against irradiance and temperature measured at seedling plot positions, there were consistent and clear distinctions among species across the gap-understory gradient, providing limited evidence for gap partitioning in our system. Striped maple appears to be a superior generalist, red maple is a weaker generalist, and sugar maple shows the poorest performance in a manner that is nearly insensitive to the gap-understory gradient, in our experimental system.},

This paper outlines parameters that the authors believe to be essential to any model of recruitment that predicts regeneration density following natural and human-based disturbance in the boreal forest. Specifically, they outline five biotic parameters:

Basal area (pre-disturbance)
Seed Mass
Asexual reproduction capacity
Dorman seed-bank capacity
Shade tolerance

They also outline four abiotic (disturbance) parameters:

Colonization distance (after disturbance)
Disturbance return time (affects seed production)
Severity
Specificity (e.g. spruce budworm damage limited to balsam fir and white spruce)

This paper discusses each of these parameters in some detail, and suggests a research agenda by which to incorporate them into landscape-scale forest models.

This paper characterizes the formation of canopy gaps in boreal aspen forests in Ontario at various times since fire. It examines the mechanisms behind the formation of canopy gaps (e.g. fungus, windthrow, etc.) as well as canopy gap transition probabilities for different species - the probability that the dominant vegetation would be a given species.
The authors conclude that the processes responsible for gap formation are consistent through time following fire events, that mean expanded gap area increased with time since fire, and that advance regeneration is an important component for transition probabilities.},

	abstract = {The sequence of species observed after a relatively large space is opened up is a consequence of the following mechanisms. {"Opportunist"} species with broad dispersal powers and rapid growth to maturity usually arrive first and occupy empty space. These species cannot invade and grow in the presence of adults of their own or other species. Several alternative mechanisms may then determine which species replace these early occupants. Three models of such mechanisms have been proposed. The first "facilitation" model suggests that the entry and growth of the later species is dependent upon the earlier species "preparing the ground"; only after this can later species colonize. Evidence in support of this model applies mainly to certain primary successions and in heterotrophic succession. A second "tolerance" model suggests that a predictable sequence is produced by the existence of species that have evolved different strategies for exploiting resources. Later species will be those able to tolerate lower levels of resources than earlier ones. Thus they can invade and grow to maturity in the presence of those that preceded them. At present there exists little evidence in support of this model. A third "inhibition" model suggests that all species resist invasions of competitors. The first occupants preempt the space and will continue to exclude or inhibit later colonists until the former die or are damaged, thus releasing resources. Only then can later colonists reach maturity. A considerable body of evidence exists in support of this model. In the majority of natural communities succession is frequently interrupted by major disturbances, such as fires, storms, insect plagues, etc., starting the process all over again. However, if not interrupted, it eventually reaches a stage in which further change is on a small scale as individuals die and are replaced. The pattern of these changes will depend upon whether individuals are more likely to be replaced by a member of their own or another species. If the former, stability will be assured. However, in terrestrial communities, conditions in the soil in the immediate vicinity of long-lived plants may become modified in such a way that offspring of the same species are much less favored than those of other species. A likely cause is the buildup of host-specific pathogenic soil organisms near a long-lived plant. In this case, the species at each local site keep changing, producing local instability. Whether the average species composition of the whole tract does not change, exhibiting global stability, or whether it keeps changing has not yet been decided for any natural community.},

This classic paper identifies three different models of succession and discusses methods needed to test hypotheses related to these models. The models are:
Facilitation - colonizing species change the environment to favor other species
Inhibition - colonizing species keeps environment unsuitable for other species (e.g. allelopathy, shade)
Tolerance - 'climax' species colonize at the same time as pioneers but simply outlast them.},

	abstract = {We measured shoot architecture and photosynthesis by three species of maple (Acer pensylvanicum, A. rubrum, A. saccharum) in response to understory and small canopy gaps in the mixed deciduous forests of central New England. Trees were felled to create six cleared gaps of two sizes (8 @? 12 m, 75 m{\textasciicircum}2; 16 @? 24 m, 300 m{\textasciicircum}2). Seedlings of the three species (2160 total, 720 per species) were transplanted into five plot locations (center plus northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast gap edges) within all gaps and additional understory sites 1 yr before gap creation. Measurements of microclimates, architecture, photosynthetic performance and seedling survival and growth were made over 1 yr before, and 2 yr following, gap release. Architectural variation increased greatly over the 3-yr period. Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) and red maple (A. rubrum) increased branch numbers, leaf numbers, and total leaf areas in gaps, especially large gaps, while sugar maple (A. saccharum) showed much smaller changes. Red maple tended to increase the number of leaves while leaf size decreased; striped maple increased leaf number but held leaf size constant. Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis by these species differed within and between gap and understory sites. Red maple showed higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area than striped and sugar maple in all site/plot combinations except the large-gap south plots, where striped maple exceeded red maple. Estimated diurnal shoot-level assimilation differentiated species more than unit area assimilation rates and also altered the rank order of performance, with striped maple {\textgreater} red maple {\textgreater} sugar maple in all microsites except the large gap north. Population-level assimilation vs. irradiance response curve exhibited a similar pattern, with red maple dominating unit area rates in most microsites. In contrast, shoot assimilation curves showed striped maple {\textgreater} red maple {\textgreater} sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north, where red maple {\textgreater} striped maple. Architectural variation among these species interacted with leaf-level assimilation rates to produce some differences among these species in shoot-level assimilation across the gap-understory microclimatic gradient. Since survival and growth patterns are usually correlated with differences in whole-plant carbon assimilation, our results suggest that there is some photosynthetic potential for gap partitioning among these three species of Acer.},

Conclusions are drawn regarding the species likely to dominate different sites following severe fire and the kinds of vegetational change likely to occur on them between disturbances. Changing patterns in the non-arboreal vascular flora, moss, and lichen cover were related to changes in tree species composition with site and time.

In order to better understand the responses of boreal mixedwoods to different combinations of anthropogenic and natural disturbances, we investigated the natural regeneration of boreal mixedwoods that were previously subjected to three different harvesting treatments (clearcut, partial-cut and uncut control) and naturally regenerated, but subsequently burnt by a severe natural fire 6 years later. The study was conducted 8 years following the fire. Significant interactions were found among harvesting method, species and block in several regeneration variables. There were a total of 12 woody species (trees and shrubs) regenerated, but not all the species were present in all the sites. In general, the species richness and species diversity of the new stands were lowest on clearcut sites while the differences between partial-cut and control varied with blocks. However, the combined total density for all species was lowest on uncut control sites. Density and regeneration index data show that trembling aspen was the predominant tree species in all stands except at one uncut control site where jack pine was the dominant species. The density of trembling aspen generally declined from clearcut to partial to the uncut control. Pincherry, beaked hazel and mountain maple were the dominant shrub species in the new stands, but no general patterns were found in terms of variations in density with harvesting methods for any of the shrub species. Jack pine and white birch were the tallest tree species in the clearcut treatment while white birch was taller than jack pine in the partial-cut and control. The results suggest that active measures are necessary to restore the complex structure of the initial mixedwoods.},

In this study six levels of aspen (0, 200, 500, 1500, 4000 stems ha−1 and natural) and three levels of spruce (0, 500 and 1000 stems ha−1) densities have been created.

Data from four locations demonstrate substantial variation in initial aspen densities following clearcutting of aspen dominated stands. After 9 years densities begin to converge with the highest rates of mortality associated with high starting densities. A model was developed that shows a significant relationship between the proportion of trees surviving to the end of a year and the density at the beginning of the year. Size-density relationships based on quadratic mean root collar diameter, mean tree volume and mean tree height are presented.

Three to four years following spacing of aspen to densities ranging from 200 to 4000 stems ha−1 there were no significant effects of density on aspen size. In addition, spacing of the aspen had no significant effect on spruce height at year 9 (3–4 years after spacing), but spruce root collar diameter ({RCD)} was significantly smaller in the unspaced compared to the spaced plots. The ratio of height to root collar diameter ({HDR)} for white spruce showed a significant and clear response to aspen density and increased with increasing aspen density.},

	abstract = {Throughout most of its range, the Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) is generally associated with coniferous forests, but it also breeds in mixedwood and deciduous stands. To measure the relative use of deciduous and coniferous trees in pristine boreal mixedwood stands of northern Alberta, we examined the influence of conifer distribution on territory placement at the mesohabitat scale (25-ha study plots) and substrate use for singing and foraging at the microhabitat scale (within individual territories). Black-throated Green Warblers clustered their territories where conifers reached their highest density, and tended to avoid areas where conifers were rare or absent. At the microhabitat scale, logistic regression models indicate that tree species and diameter at breast height were significant predictors of tree use; Black-throated Green Warblers mainly used large white spruce (Picea glauca) trees as songposts and foraging substrates. For foraging, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (P. balsamifera), the two most abundant tree species in our plots, were less frequently used than white spruce, whereas paper birch (Betula papyrifera) was used according to its availability. These results indicate that Black-throated Green Warblers were relatively stereotyped in their substrate use, in spite of the availability of both deciduous and coniferous trees. However, the treefall gaps and dense deciduous shrub layer typical of old boreal mixedwood stands might be important at the fledgling stage. Thus, the conversion of mixedwood forests into pure deciduous stands and conifer plantations could have negative impacts on this and other ecologically-similar species in the boreal forest.},

	abstract = {Patterns of moss and liverwort species diversity species richness and species turnover (ß-diversity) - in three conifer-dominated boreal forest stands of northern Alberta, Canada are described. We examined the relationship between bryophyte species diversity and micro-environment at two sample grains, the microsite - substrate types for moss colonization; logs, stumps, tree bases, undisturbed patches of forest floor (dominated by feather moss species), and disturbed patches of forest floor - and the mesosite (25 m x 25 m plots). Microsite type and properties (e.g. decay class, hardwood vs softwood, {pH)} were the principal predictors of bryophyte species diversity and not micro-environment variation among mesosites. Microsite type was the strongest predictor of microsite species richness and ß-diversity was higher among microsites and types and within microsites than among mesosites or stands. Microsite properties were significant predictors of species richness for all microsite types. Log and stump decay classes, influenced also by hardwood vs soft-wood predicted species richness of woody microsite types and soil {pH} and moisture predicted species richness of forest floor microsites. ß-diversity was highest for tree bases and disturbed patches of forest floor and lowest for logs. Mesosite ßdiversity was lower than that among microsites, and mesosite species richness was not well explained by measured environmental parameters. Results suggest that in conifer-dominated boreal stands, species richness of microsites is only negligibly influenced by within-stand variation at the mesosite grain and that substrate characteristics are the most important predictors of bryophyte species diversity in this ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Progress in understanding the patterns of plant diversity requires a conceptualization and quantification of the hierarchy of patch configuration that exists in plant communities across levels of observation. In order to identify the scales at which vascular plant diversity is maximized, we investigated the hierarchical organization of understory vascular plant diversity in relation to canopy patch types in mature boreal mixedwood forests in western Canada. In each of two study areas within a 30 km2 landscape (55° N, 112° E) we sampled four canopy patch types: conifer, mixed conifer-broadleaf, broadleaf and canopy gaps. Understory diversity (richness and Shannon’s (H′) index) was additively partitioned in relation to these four canopy patch types across a hierarchy of four scales; α-individual patch + β1-among patches within canopy patch type + β2-among canopy patch types within area + β3-between areas. We also examined understory species abundance patterns by means of rank-abundance plots fitted to relative abundance models. The largest partition of species richness was among patches within canopy patch type (β1). For Shannon diversity index, the largest partition was at the within-individual patch level (α1) indicating that evenness was high at the patch level but that dominance increased at higher levels in the hierarchy. The assessment of relative abundance by means of rank abundance plots suggested that the canopy patch types differed in terms of the ecological mechanisms influencing diversity patterns. Considering plant diversity within a hierarchical framework is critical for the understanding and management of biodiversity as maximum levels of plant richness and evenness do not necessarily occur at the same observational scales. Management practices which retain the natural hierarchies of vegetation patches will help conserve plant community richness and diversity.},

	abstract = {Overstory manipulation and vegetation control treatments were applied at three experimental locations in northern Ontario, Canada, to examine shelter and competition effects on planted white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Overstories were nearly pure trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) or aspen-conifer mixedwoods. Overstory treatments included clear-cutting, uniform shelterwood (40\% canopy removal), strip shelterwood (widths from 0.5 to {1.0H}, where H is the height of dominants), patch shelterwood (diameter about {1.0H)}, narrow strips (width {0.25H)}, and intact overstory. Vegetation-control treatments included herbicide and no-herbicide treatments. Second-year seedling growth was poorest under intact overstories and in {0.25H} strips, and vegetation control had little effect on growth in this situation. Vegetation control in clearcuts increased seedling diameter but not height growth. In shelterwood treatments, however, vegetation control often increased both diameter and height growth. Greatest..., Des traitements impliquant la modification de l'étage dominant et le contrôle de la végétation ont été appliqués à trois sites expérimentaux du nord de {l'Ontario}, au Canada, en vue d'examiner les effets d'abri et de concurrence sur l'épinette blanche (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) plantée. L'étage dominant était formé soit de peuplier faux-tremble pur (Populus tremuloides Michx.), soit d'une forêt mixte de peupliers et de conifères. Les traitements de l'étage dominant comprenaient la coupe à blanc, la coupe progressive uniforme (prélèvement de 40\% de la canopée), la coupe progressive par bandes (largeurs de 0,5 à {1,0H}, où H représente la hauteur des dominants), la coupe progressive par bouquets (diamètre d'environ {1,0H)}, la coupe par bandes étroites (largeur de {0,25H)} et l'absence de traitement laissant l'étage dominant intact.
